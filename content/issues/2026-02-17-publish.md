An issue with hardware security key is currently preventing builds from being
signed with our GPG key. This affects both direct uploads and builds performed
on Flathub infra.

While build service remains technically operational, no builds can be signed
and thus published. We are in contact with the company hosting the server and
working on delivering a new key. {{< track "2026-02-20 01:38:00" >}}

Data centre staff attempted reseating the signing key across available USB ports
without success. We are now arranging delivery and installation of a replacement
key. {{< track "2026-02-20 16:46:00" >}}
