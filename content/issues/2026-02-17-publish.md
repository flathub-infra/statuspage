An issue with hardware security key is currently preventing builds from
being signed with our GPG key. This affects both direct uploads and
builds performed on Flathub infra. Since no builds can be signed thus
published, the build service including test builds are also
disrupted. {{< track "2026-02-17 13:56:00" >}}

We are in contact with the data center staff to investigate the
issue physically. {{< track "2026-02-19 17:49:00" >}}

Data centre staff attempted reseating the signing key across available
USB ports without success. We are now arranging delivery and
installation of a replacement key. {{< track "2026-02-20 16:46:00" >}}

We successfully managed to install the new Yubikey. {{< track "2026-02-23 14:04:00" >}}

**Information**

We will soon restart all affected official builds in batches and they
should be published within a couple of hours. Affected direct uploaders
will be informed to restart builds from their end. Once this process
is complete, some services which were disabled (to reduce impact)
will be re-enabled one by one.

Once the test build service is available, any affected test builds on
pull requests will need to be manually restarted by commenting
"bot, build" by the respective maintainer or contributor.

Please allow us some time to finish the entire process outlined above.
Publishing may take longer than usual due the large number of builds
in the queue. Please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/issues)
for any further query about missing or unpublished builds. Further
updates will be posted in the statuspage.

All affected builds were successfully restarted and they finished building. {{< track "2026-02-23 16:40:00" >}}

The repository server is still experiencing some issues. {{< track "2026-02-23 17:30:00" >}}

The incident should be resolved now and services are being restarted. {{< track "2026-02-23 18:50:00" >}}
