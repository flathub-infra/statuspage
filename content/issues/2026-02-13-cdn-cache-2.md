Due to a cache invalidation issue, the CDN was serving stale and
non-existent index files. As a result Flathub builds failed while
attempting to download dependencies and any general Flatpak clients
experienced hangs or download
failures. {{< track "2026-02-13 00:00:00" >}}

**Resolved:** The issue was resolved after the cache was
invalidated. {{< track "2026-02-14 00:00:00" >}}
